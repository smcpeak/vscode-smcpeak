The files in this directory were copied from the
extensions/vscode-api-tests/src directory of the
[vscode github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
release version 1.37.1.

The files are:

* memfs.ts: Provides an in-memory virtual file system so tests can
  pretend to read and write files without disturbing the real file
  system

* utils.ts: Test utilities such as 'createRandomFile'.
